Some other built in shaders, which are not actually glitchy.

"enableFXAA" tries to smooth out ugly edges of your geometry.

"enableBloom" activates a shader, which tries to imitate the effect you might sometimes notice,
if you're looking at light sources or very bright surfaces. It doesn't look amazing for now,
but it can add funky artifacts, if you're using the glitch shaders and the "feedback" at the same time.
