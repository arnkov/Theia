Videos are loaded from the data/movies directory.

"useSpout" used to have some effect for Windows users. Will be back soon.

"useVideo": to make this work, you need to encode your videos as Hap.
Hap-Q is not supported. The easiest tool I know of is this one:

"palidrome" changes the playmode from a normal loop to playing back and forth.

"blendMode" changes the blend mode:
0 none
1 add
2 multiply
3 substract
4 alpha
If the mode is 0, you will only be able to see the SECOND video,
because it is drawn on top of the first. 
More blend modes are to be added.
