Here you can acces some uniforms passed to your custom shaders.
Have a look at the example shader, if you want to know, what's going on.
There are also lots of good ressources out there.

"u_resolution" does not appear in the gui. It is set automatically.

"u_time" same as above.

"posX/posY" will be accessible through a "uniform vec2 u_pos", if you need them.

"shaderVal0/1" are accessible as "u_val0" and "u_val1", just in case you need something else.

If you're using sound input, you can also use:
"uniform vec3 u_beat": will return if there is a kick(.x), a snare(.y) or a hat(wanna guess?).
"u_bang" will return 1.0, if Theia detected any onset, else 0.0. I'd recommend using this for the kick.
"u_magnitude" will return the magnitude.
"u_rms" will return the rms. You can scale it with the rmsMultiplier.
