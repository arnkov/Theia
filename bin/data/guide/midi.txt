The way Theia uses Midi is currently being reworked.
For now, you can map the bare minimum to some control knobs
using the xml file under data/settings.

button01 - 03 lets you control whether you want to draw video,
lua scetches or shaders.

note01 - 03 is mapped to kick, snare and hat.
You can specify your drum channel and then choose the corresponding notes.
This will only take effect, if the app is not listening to sound.

If you are not shure, which buttons are which, you can have a look under "SHOW INFO".
For more control you might want to use tools like for example MidiGyver, 
to convert your messages to OSC. And then proceed with the standard osc-mappings.

Changes in the specified device will only take effect after restarting the midi listener.
