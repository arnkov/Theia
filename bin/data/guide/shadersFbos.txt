A shader is a small programm directly telling your graphics card, what to do.
There are some built in shaders, which make some glitch effects.
You can find them under data/shaders/gl3.
don't be afraid to modify them.

"shaderRandomness" controls, how often parameters are triggered by the onset detection.

"randomGlitch": whether or not glitches should be triggered by onset.

"randColourGlitch": same as above.

"randomFbo": All the videos and Lua scripts are drawn into a frame buffer object.
It's simply a way, to store pixels to access them later, for example in the glitch shaders.
If the fbo doesn't get cleared you will be able to see some from the previous frames,
if nothing get's drawn on top of them. For example, if you're using Hap-Alpha and some masked video.
If checked, it will only be cleared, if the last onset is a few seconds in the past.

"clearFbo": whether or not the Fbo get's cleared every frame.
Get's overridden by "randomFbo".

"feedback" is not actually a feedback. It will cause older pixels, to slowly disappear,
if you do not clear the fbo andf don't draw something on top.
