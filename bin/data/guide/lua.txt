Lua is a nice little scripting language, which is very easy to learn.
You can include your own scetches by dropping them into "data/scripts".
For now, the lua-api consists of the standard modules and some bindings to openFrameworks.
The whole shabang is to be subject of changes.
If you want to know, how it works, have a look at example.lua and ofBindings.h.
You can simply add your own bindings, just edit ofBindings.h and don't forget to
add your new stuff to ofApp.h/.cpp.

The actual buttons and sliders should be self documenting.
Please note, that for now you will have to declare at least
bang (bool)
mangitude (number)
kick (number)
snare (number)
hat (number)
as there are no error callbacks and do possibilities to check, if a variable exists at the moment.
These parameters will automatically set by Theia and you can use them, to drive things in your scetch.

Also you need to use at least these functions:
function setup(): gets called if the script is loaded
function update(): gets called in the "update" method of Theia
function draw(): gets called in the "draw" method
function exit(): gets called if you load a new script, or close Theia.
