Theia is a small VJ-app, built on top of openFrameworks,
designed to be as lighweight as possible.

It is a tool specificly written to fit my needs, so it might or might not work for you.
I'm open to proposals or feature requests, but please understand,
that I won't feel obliged, to implement every proposal.

It's tested on Windows and Ubuntu, but it should work on Mac as well.
Unfortunetly it won't work on Raspberry.
It's very much a work in progress and I'm actually not a programmer,
so please don't expect too much.

Features:
-sound input
-osc input
-midi input
-video playback and effects
-shader live coding
-lua live coding

Known issues:
-Files might get loaded in an unexpected order on Linux.
(Help appreciated)
-If you dock this window at the "MAIN CONTROLS" window and
then close it, you can suddenly close the main Window too,
which will crash Theia. Should easily be fixed, but isn't
my top priority right now. Just don't.
-shader file names appear twice in the dropdown,
since there is a .vert and a .frag for each,
but oF doesn't need the extension, to load one.
-for now, drawing something doesn't block
drawing something else. The last thing, that get's
called in Theia's "draw" method, will be drawn on top.
-"feedback" doesn't work on videos, will be fixed in next release.
If you reaaaaally needed it, you could propably use a video with only a
really small alpha value as video 2 and use the alpha-blendMode.

TODO:
-extend lua bindigs
-reimplement automatic shader reloading
-implement automatic lua script reloading
-add control over font size
