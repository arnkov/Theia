gives you control over which input you might want to use.
And some other stuff, I didn't know where to put.

"Fullscreen" toggles the window mode of the performace window.

"useSound" toggles whether or not the app tries using sound input.
On Windows I highly recommend using ASIO, on Linux, you should try JACK.
Accordingly you can choose the device number.
Changes to the device number only take effect, if you restart the sound listener.
This might or might not work, depending on your setup.
Please check the console for more info, if something doesn't work.

"onsetMinThreshold" determines how loud the sound should be for the App, 
to trigger onset detection and "onsetDecayRate" let's you control, 
how long the onset will be set to "true". 
It will set the boolean "bang" in your scripts to "true".
In your custom shaders it will set the uniform "u_bang" to 1.0.
If you checked "randomColour" it will also set new colours.

"useOSC" let's you use OSC messages to control Theia on port 8000.
For now, the port can only be changed in the source code.
See: guiApp.h line 13
This will be subject to changes as soon as possible.

"useMIDI" does the same for Midi messages.

"showInfo" opens a small panel with Informations about whats going in with the sound.
MIDI and OSC information will be supported soon.

"globalRandomness" let's you control, how often things are triggered,
if Theia detected an onset. If it's set to 1.0 it will trigger every time,
which might sometimes be a bit much.
There used to be more parameters chained to "globalRandom",
maybe they will come back, or this will be moved somewhere else.
In addition the app has a separate kick, snare and hat detection.
More about that later.
